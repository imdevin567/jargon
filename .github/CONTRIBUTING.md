# Contributor's Agreement

You are under no obligation whatsoever to provide any bug fixes, patches, or upgrades to the features, functionality or performance of the source code ("Enhancements") to anyone; however, if you choose to make your Enhancements available either publicly, or directly to the project, without imposing a separate written license agreement for such Enhancements, then you hereby grant the following license: a non-exclusive, royalty-free perpetual license to install, use, modify, prepare derivative works, incorporate into other computer software, distribute, and sublicense such enhancements or derivative works thereof, in binary and source code form.

### Compliance

All commits need to be signed-off in accordance with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as per below.

#### License

This project is licensed under the MIT License.

### Reporting a suspected vulnerability / security issue

If you would like to report a suspected vulnerability / security issue, please email devin@devinyoungweb.com. Bear in mind that this is a community project, and it may take a few days to get back to you.

#### Sign your work

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for a patch. Your
signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):
